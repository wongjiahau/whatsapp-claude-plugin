# WhatsApp — Access & Delivery

WhatsApp has no bot API — this channel connects as a **linked device** (like WhatsApp Web). Any contact who can message the linked phone number can reach the server. The access model described here decides who gets through.

By default, a DM from an unknown sender triggers **pairing**: the server replies with a 6-character code and drops the message. You run `/whatsapp-channel:access pair <code>` from your Claude Code session to approve them. Once approved, their messages pass through.

All state lives in `~/.whatsapp-channel/access.json`. The `/whatsapp-channel:access` skill commands edit this file; the server re-reads it on every inbound message, so changes take effect without a restart. Set `WHATSAPP_ACCESS_MODE=static` to pin config to what was on disk at boot (pairing is unavailable in static mode since it requires runtime writes).

| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Default policy      | `pairing`                                         |
| Sender ID           | WhatsApp JID (e.g. `886912345678@s.whatsapp.net`) |
| Group key           | Group JID (e.g. `120363424405607157@g.us`)        |

| Config file         | `~/.whatsapp-channel/access.json`                 |

## DM policies

`dmPolicy` controls how DMs from senders not on the allowlist are handled.

| Policy              | Behavior                                                                                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pairing` (default) | Reply with a pairing code, drop the message. Approve with `/whatsapp-channel:access pair <code>`. |
| `allowlist`         | Drop silently. No reply. Prevents strangers from knowing the linked device is active.             |
| `disabled`          | Drop everything, including allowlisted users and groups.                                          |

```
/whatsapp-channel:access policy allowlist
```

## User IDs (JIDs)

WhatsApp identifies users by **JIDs** — phone number + `@s.whatsapp.net`, e.g. `886912345678@s.whatsapp.net`. The allowlist stores JIDs.

Pairing captures the JID automatically. To add one manually, use the phone number with country code, no leading `+`, followed by `@s.whatsapp.net`.

```
/whatsapp-channel:access allow 886912345678@s.whatsapp.net
/whatsapp-channel:access remove 886912345678@s.whatsapp.net
```

## Groups

Groups are off by default. Opt each one in individually.

```
/whatsapp-channel:access group add 120363424405607157@g.us
```

Group JIDs end in `@g.us`. To find one, add the linked device to the group — the server logs the group JID when it receives a message from an unenabled group.

With the default `requireMention: false`, the server responds to every message. Pass `--mention` to require @mention, or `--allow jid1,jid2` to restrict which members can trigger it. Pass `--roster` to also grant roster access (see below) — off by default, same as everything else. Pass `--no-context` to keep a mention-gated group's unaddressed messages out of the local log entirely (see "Mention detection" below).

Running `group add` again on an already-configured group **merges**, it doesn't start over: any flag you don't pass this time keeps whatever was already set. Adding `--roster` to a group that already has `--mention` on doesn't reset `--mention` back off — only the flags you actually pass change anything. To explicitly turn `--mention` or `--roster` back off (rather than just never setting them), pass `--no-mention` / `--no-roster` — passing both a flag and its negation at once is refused, not silently resolved one way.

```
/whatsapp-channel:access group add 120363424405607157@g.us
/whatsapp-channel:access group add 120363424405607157@g.us --mention
/whatsapp-channel:access group add 120363424405607157@g.us --allow 886912345678@s.whatsapp.net
/whatsapp-channel:access group add 120363424405607157@g.us --roster
/whatsapp-channel:access group add 120363424405607157@g.us --no-roster
/whatsapp-channel:access group rm 120363424405607157@g.us
```

### Per-group personality & memory

Each enabled group gets a config directory at `~/.whatsapp-channel/groups/<groupJid>/`:

| File        | Purpose                                                                            |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `config.md` | Personality, goals, and instructions for Claude in this group. User edits this.    |
| `memory.md` | Conversation summaries appended by Claude automatically. Persists across sessions. |

Created automatically when a group is added. Edit `config.md` to customize Claude's behavior per group. View or clear with `/whatsapp-channel:access group config <jid>` and `/whatsapp-channel:access group memory <jid>`.

### LID identifiers

Baileys 7 uses LID (Local Identifier) format alongside phone JIDs. The same person may appear as both `16024101202@s.whatsapp.net` and `21737517412478@lid`. The server maintains a mapping at `~/.whatsapp-channel/lid-map.json` and resolves both formats automatically. Both work in allowlists.

## Names and privacy

**On by default.** The server caches saved contact names from WhatsApp's own contact sync (the same list your phone already has) at `~/.whatsapp-channel/contacts.json` — never the `contacts.md` some people keep for their own DM habits, which this plugin never reads. Set `WHATSAPP_CACHE_CONTACTS=0` to turn that off. Only a contact's **name** is cached this way, and only a name — self-reported "About"/display text (`.notify`) is kept separately and never trusted for anything security-relevant, since anyone messaging the account can set that to whatever they want, including someone else's real name or number.

With it off, name resolution and masking still work for the lifetime of the running server (built fresh each run from WhatsApp's own contact sync), it just isn't written to disk — so a restart starts blank again and the wizard's contact screen has nothing to rank. Either way, `WHATSAPP_ACCESS_MODE=static` disables this cache regardless of `WHATSAPP_CACHE_CONTACTS` — a static deployment can't be made to write local state by an env var. The recency cache the wizard ranks by (`dm-activity.json`) follows the same switch, since it's the same kind of per-sender data — including for a sender the access gate rejected, which is exactly what the opt-out is there for.

Saved names sync on connect only when the cache holds no saved name at all (WhatsApp otherwise sends them just once, at linking); the server asks for the contact list again, logs a count (`address book synced: 3 saved name(s)` — never a name or number), and stops asking once one is cached. It never asks more than once a day (tracked in `~/.whatsapp-channel/.addressbook-sync`, so a restart doesn't reset the clock), and never runs with `WHATSAPP_CACHE_CONTACTS=0` or in static mode. After it, `contacts.json` holds the names of everyone saved on your phone, on your disk only. Chat-list order cannot be re-fetched, so the wizard ranks by the DM activity it has seen since.

Someone who merely messaged the account and was never approved doesn't sit in these caches forever: on the server's hourly prune, a `dm-activity.json` entry older than **90 days** is dropped unless its number is allowlisted (for a DM or any group), and a `contacts.json` entry with no saved name is dropped once it has neither an allowlist entry nor any activity younger than that. Saved names — your own phone's address book — never age out this way.

**Names may reach the AI model; raw phone numbers should not.** When you ask Claude to reply and mention someone, it can use a saved name (`"Akash"`) instead of a number — that name is what appears in Claude's context. Anywhere a number would otherwise be shown to a human (an ambiguous-name error, `group_roster` for someone with no saved name) it's masked to the last 4 digits (`•••••5122`) before it's built into any string, not filtered afterward.

This is a **best-effort mitigation, not a hard guarantee**: it depends on a saved contact actually being a name and not, say, a phone number typed into the name field, and on `.notify` not being trusted in place of it (checked explicitly for group rosters — see below). If you'd rather no name data ever reaches an AI model at all, don't grant any group `roster` access and use raw JIDs/numbers in `mentions` instead of names.

The in-session `review` (see the wizard section below) never lets the candidate lists enter the session — only the `+`/`-` list comes back, by saved name or masked number.

## Group roster & @all mentions

`group_roster` (an MCP tool) and `"all"` (a reserved value in the `reply` tool's `mentions` array) both require a group's `roster` flag — separate from whether Claude can act in the group at all, so you can let Claude reply in a large group without ever handing it the member list.

- **`group_roster`** lists a group's current members by saved contact name, or a masked number when no name is known. It never shows a raw number, even when a contact's self-reported name happens to look like one.
- **`"all"` in `mentions`** expands server-side to every current participant, fetched live from WhatsApp group metadata — so it mentions everyone even for members with no saved contact name, and however many there are. A saved contact literally named "All" is unaffected: name resolution always wins over the reserved value.

Both fail with a clear error if the group's `roster` flag isn't granted.

## Guided bulk setup (wizard)

`bun scripts/access.ts wizard` draws **one screen**: a search line, a `Picked:` chip
line, then **CONTACTS** on the left and **GROUPS** on the right - everything Claude
can already reach comes pre-ticked, so the screen shows you the current state instead
of an empty list. Untick to take access away, tick to grant, in the same pass.

Keys: type to filter both columns, `↑↓` move, `Tab` (or `←→`) switches column,
`Space` toggles, `Enter` in the search box ticks the highlighted row and clears the
search, `Enter` on an empty search box submits, `Backspace` on an empty search box
removes the last chip, `r` flags a group you are granting for roster access, `Ctrl+Z`
undoes one step, `Ctrl+R` restores the access list from before the last run, `Esc`
clears the search or quits, `Ctrl+C` quits. Mouse is best effort: click a row to
toggle it, click a chip's `×` to remove it.

A chip with `-` and struck through is a grant you are taking away; a chip with `+` is
a new grant.

**It needs a real terminal.** Run it through a pipe or from inside an AI session and
it says so and exits, rather than hanging.

`/whatsapp-channel:access review` opens this same screen in a new terminal window, waits for you, and reports back only what changed; `bun scripts/access.ts undo` (or `wizard --undo`) is still the one step back.

- Roster is still asked only for groups you are granting in this run - flag one with
  `r` while it is ticked. An already-granted group keeps whatever roster flag it has
  (change it with `group add --roster` / `--no-roster`).
- Archived groups are still skipped by default and the wizard says how many it hid —
  pass `--include-archived` to include them.
- Nothing is written until you have seen the full `+`/`-` list and answered **Apply these changes?**. Answer `n`, or press Ctrl-C at any point, and nothing is written at all.
- After a write, `bun scripts/access.ts wizard --undo` (or plain `undo`) puts the access list back to just before that run - run it with `--dry-run` first. Cached names are not restored, only the access list.
- A group the wizard adds gets `requireMention: true` (only reply when addressed) — a more cautious default than `group add`'s own CLI default of `false` (reply to everything), deliberately: the wizard is the guided path for a less technical setup, the CLI is for someone already comfortable with explicit flags. Change it after the fact with `group add --mention` or `--no-mention`.
- Narrow terminal (under 70 columns)? The two columns stack instead of sitting side
  by side. `NO_COLOR` is respected.

### Taking access back (`wizard --revoke`)

`--revoke` is now an **alias for the same screen** - there is only one wizard, and
revoking is unticking a row that came pre-ticked. The old command keeps working so a
habit or an old note does not break.

- **An untouched screen changes nothing.** Submitting without touching a tick is
  read as "leave everything as it is" - it can neither remove nor grant.
- Revoking a group keeps its `config.md` and `memory.md`, same as `group rm`, in case
  you add it back.
- Revoking a contact **keeps their cached name and recency** - only the allowlist
  entry goes. `remove <jid>` still forgets a cached name (unchanged), and
  `forget <jid>` still clears one deliberately - see "Removing someone already
  granted access" below.

Group/contact names and recency come from caches (`~/.whatsapp-channel/groups-meta.json`, `dm-activity.json`, `contacts.json`) that only the running server writes — automatically, as WhatsApp reports chat activity, no manual step needed once the account has connected at least once. If it's never connected yet, the wizard has nothing to show; pair it first. `groups-meta.json` is always written; `dm-activity.json` and `contacts.json` follow `WHATSAPP_CACHE_CONTACTS`, which is on unless you set it to `0` (see "Names and privacy" above) — with it off, the CONTACTS column has nothing to rank. The CONTACTS column lists recent DM activity first, then every contact whose _saved_ name arrived from the phone's contact sync — so someone you've never messaged is still findable by name. A number with no saved name is never offered: if it was not worth saving on the phone it is not worth a row, and a self-reported display name never earns one on its own. The only unnamed rows are numbers that are _already_ allowed — they sit at the bottom of the column, masked, so they can still be unticked. The wizard says so on screen instead of silently leaving the column empty: one line when no DM activity is on record at all, another when there is a record but nothing new in it. Its search line runs over the whole cached pool, so every contact on record is reachable without paging.

It's a terminal command, deliberately not a Claude Code skill: running it yourself, outside any chat, is what makes this true —

> No group or contact data was sent to any AI model during this setup — this ran entirely in your terminal.

The `/whatsapp-channel:access` skill will point you at it if you ask for guided setup there, but will never run it on your behalf.

### Removing someone already granted access

`/whatsapp-channel:access remove <jid>` (or the equivalent CLI command) also forgets their cached name from `contacts.json`, not just their allowlist entry — it does **not** touch `lid-map.json` (needed for correct message/mention matching if they're still an active participant in a group you can see) and it does **not** remove them from any shared group or block them on WhatsApp, neither of which this plugin does. If they're still in a group with roster access, they'll show up there as a masked number from then on instead of by name — the honest consequence of choosing to forget someone this plugin was never going to remove from a group.

### Forgetting a stranger who was never allowlisted

`remove` requires the JID to actually be on the allowlist, and refuses otherwise — but with caching on, a name/activity entry gets cached the moment anyone DMs once, allowlisted or not (contact and chat sync events fire before the access gate runs). `bun scripts/access.ts forget <jid>` purges the cached name and activity entry directly, with no allowlist requirement — the general-purpose way to clear someone's cached identity regardless of whether they were ever approved.

## Mention detection

A message that does **not** trigger the server in such a group is still kept, text only, in `~/.whatsapp-channel/messages.jsonl` with `routed: false`, so `catch_up` can show you the room; it is never routed, notified or counted as unreplied (retention rules: [USAGE.md, "Your own replies"](./USAGE.md#your-own-replies)). Nothing is kept for a group that is not allowlisted or for a sender the group's own `allowFrom` rejects. If you'd rather mention gating keep its stricter pre-0.22 meaning for a group — _nothing_ about the room is stored unless Claude was addressed — opt that group out with `group add <jid> --no-context` (`--context` turns it back on; a group that never set it keeps context, the 0.22.0 default). This is per group, because the trade is per group: context is what lets Claude draft a message that fits the conversation, and the people it stores are the group's other members.

In groups with `requireMention: true`, any of the following triggers the server:

- A structured @mention of the linked account's JID
- A match against any regex in `mentionPatterns`

```
/whatsapp-channel:access set mentionPatterns '["claude", "assistant"]'
```

## Delivery

Configure outbound behavior with `/whatsapp-channel:access set <key> <value>`.

**`ackReaction`** reacts to inbound messages on receipt. WhatsApp supports **any emoji** — there's no fixed whitelist like Telegram.

```
/whatsapp-channel:access set ackReaction 👀
/whatsapp-channel:access set ackReaction ""
```

**`replyToMode`** controls threading on chunked replies. When a long response is split, `first` (default) threads only the first chunk under the inbound message; `all` threads every chunk; `off` sends all chunks standalone.

**`textChunkLimit`** sets the split threshold. Default is 4096.

**`chunkMode`** chooses the split strategy: `length` cuts exactly at the limit; `newline` prefers paragraph boundaries.

### Proactive notifications

**On by default.** Claude is told to surface things to you the moment they happen, rather than waiting for its next natural reply: an inbound message arriving, this terminal's role _changing_ (becoming primary/secondary, or losing/regaining the primary connection — see multi-terminal sync below; the initial role a terminal starts in isn't a change and never announces), a pairing code, and the "paired and connected" confirmation. Set `WHATSAPP_QUIET=1` to turn all of that off for one terminal — a pairing code you need is always in the diagnostics log regardless, so nothing is lost. It's an env var, not a saved setting, so it only applies to sessions started with it set — nothing persists it past the terminal that set it.

This only controls whether Claude _announces_ a role change. The underlying primary/secondary mechanism, the role file, and the statusline segment (see `scripts/statusline-role.ts`) all keep working the same either way. The update notice below is separate — it isn't gated by `WHATSAPP_QUIET`.

### Update notice

Two different notices, from the same script (`scripts/update-notice.ts`):

**"What's new"** — the first Claude Code session that starts after the plugin's version has changed since it last recorded one (tracked per account in `~/.whatsapp-channel/.last-seen-version`) gets a one-time notice listing what changed, including a nudge toward the [guided setup wizard](#guided-bulk-setup-wizard) if you haven't run it yet — the wizard itself has always required running manually, this notice is just what tells you it exists. Shown once per version, not on every session start of the same version. Delivered by the SessionStart hook (`hooks-handlers/session-start.sh`, calling `scripts/update-notice.ts`), the same hook that guides first-time setup — a version bump has nothing to do with the WhatsApp connection itself, so it doesn't come from `server.ts`. Skipped in `WHATSAPP_ACCESS_MODE=static`, which can't write local state (see above).

**"Update available"** — tells you a newer version exists that you have **not** installed yet, which the notice above can never do (it reads the running plugin's own `plugin.json`, so by the time it fires you already have the update). It compares the running version against what your marketplace clone advertises — both already on disk, refreshed by Claude Code itself, so there is no network call and nothing to configure. Unlike the one-time notice it is not gated on `.last-seen-version`: it repeats every session until you actually update, and goes quiet by itself once you do. Also skipped in static mode.

| `/whatsapp-channel:access set owner 886912345678@s.whatsapp.net` | The chat that receives permission requests and the only one that may approve them. Must already be on `allowFrom` (so it cannot be set before the first connect on a fresh install, when the linked account is added). Stamped once by the server if missing; removing that contact later sends requests to your own chat until you set a new one. |

## Config file

`~/.whatsapp-channel/access.json`. Absent file is equivalent to `pairing` policy with empty lists, so the first DM triggers pairing.

```jsonc
{
  // Handling for DMs from senders not in allowFrom.
  "dmPolicy": "pairing",

  // WhatsApp JIDs allowed to DM.
  "allowFrom": ["886912345678@s.whatsapp.net"],

  // Where permission requests go and who may approve them. Must be in allowFrom.
  // Stamped by the server when missing (the linked account on a fresh install).
  "owner": "886912345678@s.whatsapp.net",

  // Groups the channel is active in. Empty object = DM-only.
  "groups": {
    "120363424405607157@g.us": {
      // true: respond only to @mentions.
      "requireMention": true,
      // Restrict triggers to these senders. Empty = any member (subject to requireMention).
      "allowFrom": [],
      // Grants group_roster and "all" mentions. Separate from acting in the
      // group at all - see "Group roster & @all mentions" above.
      "roster": false,
    },
  },

  // Case-insensitive regexes that count as a mention.
  "mentionPatterns": ["claude"],

  // Any emoji. Empty string disables.
  "ackReaction": "👀",

  // Threading on chunked replies: first | all | off
  "replyToMode": "first",

  // Split threshold.
  "textChunkLimit": 4096,

  // length = cut at limit. newline = prefer paragraph boundaries.
  "chunkMode": "newline",
}
```
