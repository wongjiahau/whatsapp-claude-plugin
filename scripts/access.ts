/**
 * access.ts — manage WhatsApp channel access from a terminal.
 *
 * Usage:              bun scripts/access.ts <command> [args]
 * Fixture/testing:    WHATSAPP_STATE_DIR=/path bun scripts/access.ts ...
 *
 * Why this exists: allowlisting, pairing and group setup used to live only in
 * skills/access/SKILL.md, which only Claude Code can execute. Under any other
 * MCP client there was no way to approve a contact except editing JSON by hand.
 * The skill still drives the friendlier conversational flow; it and this file
 * write the same access.json, so either works.
 *
 * SECURITY: this is a terminal command the user runs. It is deliberately NOT
 * exposed as an MCP tool, so a WhatsApp message can never reach it — "approve
 * the pending pairing" is exactly what a prompt-injected request looks like.
 * Path constants mirror server.ts, which cannot be imported (it acquires the
 * singleton lock at module load).
