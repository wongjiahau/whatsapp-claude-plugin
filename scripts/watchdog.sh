# WhatsApp agent watchdog — detects stuck Claude sessions and nudges them.
# If nudging doesn't unstick it within STUCK_STREAK_LIMIT consecutive checks
# (e.g. the WhatsApp/Baileys connection itself dropped, which a nudge can't
# fix), it hard-restarts the agent instead — via $HOME/start-whatsapp-agent.sh
# if you have one, otherwise a launchd kickstart.
# Also detects API auth failures (401) in the agent's tmux pane and fires an
# external alert hook so you find out before replies silently die for hours.
# Finally, it watches for one-way silence: a Baileys socket that stays open and
# keeps sending while never receiving another inbound message again.
#
# Setup:
#   cp scripts/watchdog.sh ~/.whatsapp-channel/watchdog.sh
#   chmod +x ~/.whatsapp-channel/watchdog.sh
#
# Crontab (every 2 minutes):
#   */2 * * * * $HOME/.whatsapp-channel/watchdog.sh >> $HOME/.whatsapp-channel/watchdog.log 2>&1
#
# Auth-failure alert hook (optional but recommended):
#   If $HOME/.whatsapp-channel/notify-hook.sh exists and is executable, it is
#   invoked with one argument when the agent's API has 401'd:
#       notify-hook.sh "<alert message>"
#
#   Without a hook, the watchdog falls back to a local macOS notification
#   (only useful if you're sitting at the Mac).
#
#   Example notify-hook.sh body — pick one channel:
#     # ntfy.sh — free, no signup. Subscribe to your topic in the ntfy iOS/Android app.
#     curl -s -d "$1" "https://ntfy.sh/your-private-topic-name"
#
#     # Pushover ($5 one-time, very reliable):
#     curl -s -F "token=APP_TOKEN" -F "user=USER_KEY" -F "message=$1" \
#       https://api.pushover.net/1/messages.json
#
#     # iMessage (requires Messages.app logged in on this Mac):
#     osascript -e "tell application \"Messages\" to send \"$1\" \
#       to buddy \"+1XXXXXXXXXX\" of service \"iMessage\""

# excluded from Check 1 by the ceiling above AND produces no silence alert for
# a further 6h. The ceiling is still right - firing recovery every cycle for a
