/**
 * Prints the SessionStart hook's notice to stdout as a complete,
 * ready-to-emit JSON object, or nothing at all if there's nothing to say.
 *
 * Two different notices, and the difference matters:
 *   - "what's new"  — this install just changed version. One-time, gated on
 *                     .last-seen-version, which this script advances.
 *   - "update available" — a NEWER version exists that the user has not
 *                     installed. Not gated on anything: it repeats every
 *                     session until they actually update, and stops by
 *                     itself when they do.
 *
 * The second one is issue #2. The first can only ever announce a version the
 * user ALREADY has (it reads this plugin's own plugin.json), so on its own
 * the plugin could never tell anyone an update was waiting.
 *
 * Invoked by hooks-handlers/session-start.sh once setup is fully
 * configured — a version bump is a session-start-shaped file check,
 * unrelated to the WhatsApp connection a role change comes from, so it
 * doesn't live in server.ts (moved here per PR #22 review). A real script
 * rather than more hand-rolled bash so version comparison and JSON output
 * reuse localeCompare/JSON.stringify instead of reimplementing both.
