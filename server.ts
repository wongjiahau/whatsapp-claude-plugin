/**
 * WhatsApp channel for Claude Code.
 *
 * Self-contained MCP server using Baileys (linked-device protocol) with full
 * access control: pairing, allowlists, group support with mention-triggering.
 * State lives in ~/.whatsapp-channel/ — managed by /whatsapp-channel:access.
 *
 * WhatsApp has no bot API — this connects as a linked device (like WhatsApp Web).
 * First-time setup requires entering a pairing code on your phone (Linked Devices).

  // are whatever the sender chose to put there: anyone who can send us a
  // reaction can name any message id, including a permission request they
  // never saw. `reaction.key` is the reaction message's OWN key, stamped by
  // WhatsApp (remoteJid = the chat it arrived in, participant = the sender in
  // a group), and is the only authenticated identity available here.
  //
  // Nothing on the reacted-to key is trusted, not even as an early-out. It
  // used to skip anything with fromMe set, which cost nothing when the owner
  // is a separate contact (their device stamps our request fromMe: false) but
  // silently killed the whole documented 👍 flow for the note-to-self setup,
  // where the owner IS the linked account and every key in the chat is
  // fromMe. Its id is still the map lookup, because guessing a WhatsApp
  // message id is not the weak link — the reactor check below is.
