// `access.owner` is the single chat a permission request is delivered to and
// therefore the only chat allowed to answer it. Both halves of that live here
// — which jid gets stamped, and what counts as a typed approval — so they are
// testable without server.ts's connect-on-import side effects.

/** Which jid to store in `access.owner`, given what is already stored, the
 *  allowlist as it stood BEFORE this connect's owner auto-add, and the account
 *  this device is linked to. Returns the value to persist, or `current`
 *  unchanged when nothing should be written.
 *
 *  Two rules, both deliberate:
 *
 *  1. An existing value is never overwritten. A dedicated-bot-number setup (a
 *     second SIM running the agent, the human's own number in allowFrom) has
 *     to be able to point approvals at the human, and re-stamping on every
 *     connect made that impossible — the value came back on the next reconnect
 *     and permission requests went to the bot's own note-to-self, which nobody
 *     reads. `/whatsapp-channel:access set owner <jid>` is the way to set it.
 *
 *  2. On an install that already had an allowlist, the first stamp preserves
 *     allowFrom[0] — the target that install has been using all along — rather
 *     than silently redirecting it to the linked account. Only a fresh install
 *     (nothing allowlisted yet) stamps the linked account, which is where
 *     insertion order was never ownership in the first place. The migration
 *     therefore changes nobody's delivery chat; `access status` prints the
 *     target so a wrong one is visible instead of silent. */
