 *
 *  1. A group's own subject - the first one in the window that is not just the
 *     chat id wearing a subject's clothing. resolveGroupName falls back to the
 *     raw jid when the metadata lookup times out or its failure cooldown is
 *     active, and lines persisted during that window carry it as `group_name`.
 *     For a legacy `<creator-number>-<timestamp>@g.us` group that is the
 *     creator's full phone number. Falling through to step 3 puts it through
 *     groupAnchor instead. The persist paths are guarded too, but only from now
 *     on - this covers what is already on disk. Deliberately NOT also filtered
 *     by looksLikeNumber: that rejects any run of six digits, so real subjects
 *     like "Sprint 2026-09-05" would lose their name, and the only bad value
 *     resolveGroupName can produce is the chat id, which is already excluded.
 *  2. For a DM ONLY, the name of someone who wrote in the chat - and only if it
 *     does not look like a phone number. `user` is displaySenderName's output,
 *     and that falls back to the jid's user part when the sender has no
 *     WhatsApp profile name, so an unsaved contact would otherwise be printed
 *     as a full raw number.
 *
 *     A GROUP never takes this step. Labelling a group with whichever member
 *     happens to be first in the window makes it indistinguishable from a DM
 *     with that person, and the label then CHANGES between sessions as the
 *     window slides to a different speaker. That is not hypothetical: when a
 *     metadata lookup times out its cooldown is five minutes, so a whole run of
 *     messages carries no subject at all.
 *  3. A masked form of the chat id. groupAnchor leaves a modern
 *     `120363...@g.us` intact and masks only the phone segment of a legacy
 *     one; maskNumber keeps the last four digits of a DM.
 *

 *  messages that COUNT before the ones that do not.
 *
 *  THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR. Two different rules were being applied to one
 *  chat. The badge counts only lines `awaitingReply` calls waiting - in a
 *  mention-gated group, only messages that actually @-mentioned the owner.
 *  The view showed the last `limit` INBOUND lines of any kind. So:
 *
 *      WIL Group HUDINI @1        <- one message addressed you
 *      ...open it, and five lines of unrelated group chatter had pushed that
 *      message out of the window entirely.
 *
 *  The badge pointed at a message the view was structurally unable to show.
 *  Worse, `reply` then marks every unreplied line answered (owner, 2026-09-08:
 *  the sender sees their own full thread, so one reply addresses everything
 *  before it) - so answering the chatter silently retired a question nobody
 *  ever read, and it left the counts, the list, and every future session.
 *
 *  THE FIX IS NOT A BIGGER WINDOW. An earlier attempt showed every unanswered
 *  line, which broke the documented "last 5 each side" contract and let one
 *  busy group render thousands of lines into a single tool result. The window
 *  stays the size it always was; only the PRIORITY inside the inbound half
 *  changes. Waiting messages take those slots first, newest first; ordinary
 *  chatter fills whatever is left, so context is still there when there is
 *  room for it. The caller's `hidden` count reports any waiting lines that did
 *  not fit, which is what turns a silent drop into "+N more waiting".
 *
 *  In a DM or an ungated group every inbound line is awaiting, so this
 *  degrades to exactly the old behaviour - there is nothing to prioritise.
 *
 *  This is a window builder over ONE chat's entries, not a general merge: it
